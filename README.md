Hangman Game Using JavaScript for Class

This project is designed to get a grasp on JavaScript

I spent a good part of the week trying to write everything out myself, but was hitting consistent hurdles. Once I was able to use a class video from a previous cohort, I learned more than ever the importance of organization and cleanliness within one's code. The concept of using functions as building blocks to be called upon later also became more clear. I have a long ways to go, but I'm confident that I'll be able to re-write this game with less assistance after I have put even more time into my studies.
